As you entered the wooden building, a weak light from small candles spread a kindness of this place all over your face.
As you stepped into this small fragile shack, you saw Mike sitting on what once was a chair. His hair was floating around, carried by wind blowing trough the walls of this room.
You walked into room filled with a smell of rotting flesh. Timmy, as they call him, was lying in a mix of mud and blood, whispering his dark thoughts. Good bless his pour soul.
You opened door of what was supposed to be a house. As you walked in you saw a soul-less body thrown upon a wall, looking with his dead eyes somewhere far away
Humans. Humans it was. They are those who ruined this land on witch you stepped with your human leg. \n Freezing air filling your lungs brought not only cold, but despair inside of you, as you walked by dead trees covered by snow and dust
