As you entered the wooden building, a weak light from small candles spread a kindness of this place all over your face.
As you stepped into this small fragile shack, you saw Mike sitting on what once was a chair. His hair was floating around, carried by wind blowing trough the walls of this room.
You walked into room filled with a smell of rotting flesh. Timmy, as they call him, was lying in a mix of mud and blood, whispering his dark thoughts. Good bless his pour soul.
You opened door of what was supposed to be a house. As you walked in you saw a soul-less body thrown upon a wall, looking with his dead eyes somewhere far away, into the land of dead crows and ice.
Humans. Humans it was. They are those who ruined this land on witch you stepped with your human leg. Freezing air filling your lungs brought not only cold, but despair inside of you, as you walked by dead trees covered by snow and dust.
Dark fog crawling around your head, freezing chill sneaking between your bones and something evil lurking in depths of cave, into witch you wandered. That's what you feel... that's what you know...
Splash splash splash, you hear sound of watter dripping in the cave, splash splash splash, driving you insane, splash splash splash, from eyes in dark - there is no escape, splash splash splash ...
Sound of your steps echos trough depths of these caverns. You, now walking, hear scream of pure terror, as someone got slaughtered in this dark place.
Silence of this place makes you desperate. Your heart now cowered in its thorns of agony, beating faster and faster, as your instincts are telling you to run. Run and not to stop.
You climbed down somewhere deeper, where the fog gets darker and the fangs sharper. In front of you, a big cave stretch out into darkness. Your fingers have tightened around your axe.
